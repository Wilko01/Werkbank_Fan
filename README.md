# Fan at workbench
This ESP32 controls the fan of the work bench during welding via the button and potential meter at the ESP box. When not locally overrided by the button and potentiometer the fan of the workbench can be controlled via the logic in NodeRed to reduce the humidity in the shed.

## Description and operation instructions
The on / off button at the ESP box has priority over commands coming from NodeRed. The button turns the fan on and off and only in the off position the fan can be controlled via NodeRed. In the on position the potentiometer controls the fan and the LED display indicates the RPM in %.
In the off position the fan is turned on when a certain humidity is detected and turned off when it is below another humidity value. Opening or closing the shed door has impact as with an open door it is not logical to run the fan. Hence opening the door will immediately shut down the fan. The fan is controlled via different levels where at lower humidity levels the fan runs at a lower speed and when the hunidity level is high the fan runs at a higher speed. The fan is also turned on when the temperature is very high. The humidity logic is running in NodeRed as the shed sensor is not connected to this ESP32. To be able to override the logic there is an override variable which enables remote control and bypasing the ESP32 fan control.

 ## Technical description
The PWM fan is controlled via the PWM signal coming from the ESP32. The ESP32 is running ESPHOME and connected to Home Assistant. The sensor for the humidity is included in this module
